# Budget Me

###Budget Me is a personal budgeting application.

###This is my final project for The Iron Yard and was built in weeks 10-12.

This was my final project for the 12 week Iron Yard course.

I decided to build a budgeting app as I was a tax accountant for 15 years before deciding on a career change to development. I decided to use my accounting background to help develop an application that would be good for every day use.

This application allows users to:

  *create an account.
  *log in to their account
  *create a profile along with an uploaded profile image
