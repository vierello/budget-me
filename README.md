# Budget Me

###Budget Me is a personal budgeting application.

###This is my final project for The Iron Yard and was built in weeks 10-12.

This was my final project for the 12 week Iron Yard course.

I decided to build a budgeting app as I was a tax accountant for 15 years before deciding on a career change to development. I decided to use my accounting background to help develop an application that would be good for every day use.

This application allows users to:

User Login:

  * Create an account.
  * Log into their account.
  * Create a profile along with an uploaded profile image.

Budget Creation:

  * Create a budget.
  * Add actual expenses.
  * View the surplus or deficit in each budgeted expense category.
  * View the overall budget report.

Added Features:

  * Create goals such as a vacation savings goal or paying off a credit card.
  * Add whatever is saved to the goal.
  * View the goal savings progress bar compared to the set end date of the goal.

To build this application I used most of the technologies learned throughout my time at the Iron Yard, including:

  * Javascript
  * jQuery
  * Bootstrap
  * Backbone
  * React
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * SASS
  * Parse
  * Heroku
  * Yeoman
  * NPM
